- Fix the menu editing  
  
  - Keep pages not in menu
  - Menus is no longer part of the page
  - Menus, default only one
    - A site can create multable menus by
    - menu = Menu("ueaeuo") in static area
    
      - A menu is a selection of links and groups, (its a tree)
      - All menus found in the CMS root can be edited
      - If no menu exist we add a default menu 

    - You edit links
      - Set title
      - Set link
      - When editing you can chose a page to link to
      - Remove
      
    - You can edit groups
      - Set title
      - remove
      
  - Change directory structure, /pages, /menus /globals
      
  - Burp creates the app/cms directory on load
    - Add default.yaml
    - Add #root default page


  - Menu actions
    - action = Menu.link("Log out",:show => true) in a static area
    - action.id = "ueouoe"
    - action.href = "ueouoe"
    - action.hide
    ....
    
  - Page content
  - Global values
  - Files
  - A way to add more pages to the CMS, maybe a meta cms
  
  - Widgets
  
  
  
  page = Burp.get_page("/thsuao/htnueo") || Burp.default_page
  menu = Burp.get_menu("menu-name") || Burp.default_menu
  globals = Burp.get_globals
  
  
  globals[:header]
  page[:section_name]
  globals[:side_bar]
  page[:side_bar_content].strip.blank? ? globals[:side_bar_1] || page[:side_bar_content]
  globals[:side_bar_1]
  globals[:side_bar_2]
  globals[:footer]
  Burp:MenuHelper.as_bootstrap_top_menu(menu)
